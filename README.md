The objective of this project is to apply in practice what you learn during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering
issues in a rigorous way. The project includes two assignments:
1. The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for a problem
we provide you.
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered in point 1 above.


This application has been designed during the COVID-19 pandemic and it aims to design, develop and demonstrate anticipatory governance models for food systems using digital public goods and community-centric
